<h1>3. Branching Strategy</h1>

GitFlow will be used for the majority of the projects to be submitted as the flow is sensible and straight forward
in one humble developer's opinion

<h1>4. gitignore</h1>

The gitignore file will be used to inform Git that certain files within the project (locally stored) should not be taken into account when commit / status or
any other relevant commands are used.

It assists us in that certain languages (and development environments) create files which would not form part of the ultimate project.

<h1>6. Storage of Credentials</h1>

Through Git, credentials will be saved by means of the credential.helper.
SSH keys will be implemented at a later date in order to secure the login process.
